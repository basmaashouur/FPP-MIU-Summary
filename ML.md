## Terminology
- [ML Definitions](https://medium.com/technology-nineleaps/some-key-machine-learning-definitions-b524eb6cb48)
- [**Algorithm:**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-algorithm-and-model-in-machine-learning/) Machine learning algorithms are procedures that are implemented in code and are run on data, its provides a type of automatic programming where machine learning models represent the program.
- **Model:** Machine learning models are output by algorithms and are comprised of model data and a prediction algorithm, Machine Learning Model == Model Data + Prediction Algorithm


## [Steps](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-you-know-how-to-choose-the-right-machine-learning-algorithm-among-7-different-types-295d0b0c7f60)

### Categorize the problem
- Categorize by the input: If it is a labeled data, it’s a supervised learning problem. If it’s unlabeled data with the purpose of finding structure, it’s an unsupervised learning problem. If the solution implies to optimize an objective function by interacting with an environment, it’s a reinforcement learning problem.
- Categorize by output: If the output of the model is a number, it’s a regression problem. If the output of the model is a class, it’s a classification problem.
  If the output of the model is a set of input groups, it’s a clustering problem.
### Choose Datset
- Gathering Data or Get a ready data

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Understanding Data
  - Showing the data info
- Showing which data to remove or to fill 
- Showing distributions
- Showing correlation
- Showing any intersting patterns 


### Data Preparation
- Fill missing Data or Remove
- Encode any categorical features or labels
- Normalize your data incase of distribution

### Model Designing & Tranining & Tuning
- Split your data for tranining and testing
- Select your model 
- Train your model
- Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Select one hyperparameter
  - Show Complixity curve
  - Show learning curve
- Train you model using [Ensemble]
- Voting classifier [Multi models]
  - Auto ML
  - Compare models [Auc curve]
