## Terminology

- [**Algorithm:**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-algorithm-and-model-in-machine-learning/) Machine learning algorithms are procedures that are implemented in code and are run on data, its provides a type of automatic programming where machine learning models represent the program.
- **Model:** Machine learning models are output by algorithms and are comprised of model data and a prediction algorithm, Machine Learning Model == Model Data + Prediction Algorithm
