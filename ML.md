- [**Algorithm:**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-algorithm-and-model-in-machine-learning/) Machine learning algorithms are procedures that are implemented in code and are run on data, its provides a type of automatic programming where machine learning models represent the program.
- **Model:** Machine learning models are output by algorithms and are comprised of model data and a prediction algorithm, Machine Learning Model == Model Data + Prediction Algorithm

- Categorize the problem
  - Categorize by the input: If it is a labeled data, it’s a supervised learning problem. If it’s unlabeled data with the purpose of finding structure, it’s an unsupervised learning problem. If the solution implies to optimize an objective function by interacting with an environment, it’s a reinforcement learning problem.
  - Categorize by output: If the output of the model is a number, it’s a regression problem. If the output of the model is a class, it’s a classification problem.
  If the output of the model is a set of input groups, it’s a clustering problem.
